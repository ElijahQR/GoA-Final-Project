# FINAL PROJECT

This is my final project that deals with climate change data. Within you will find 5 data files and one python file which creates an html page with data visualizations. The 3 visuals on the top row are the main graphs while every line from then on displays a pie graph breakdown of emissions in each country by sector. Hope you enjoy!
